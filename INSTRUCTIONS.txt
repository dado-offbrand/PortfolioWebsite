Website help link:

Netlify link:
https://app.netlify.com/start

Github link:
https://github.com/dado-offbrand/BenPortfolio

NPM commands:
"npm run build"
"npm run start"

Website still needs pushed to the actual GitHub and the netlify app needs deployed. Also, how does adding extra pages end up working?
